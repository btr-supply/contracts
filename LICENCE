SECTION 2: BUSINESS SOURCE LICENSE 1.1 (Effective until Change Date)

This Business Source License 1.1 ("BSL") applies to the Licensed Work identified in the Parameters section above, licensed by the Licensor also identified above.

Full Text: https://mariadb.com/bsl11/

Highlights:
  – Source-Available: You can read and modify every line of code today.
  – Non-Production Use: Allowed for development, testing, evaluation, academic research, and demonstrations as specified below.
  – Commercial Gate: Use of the Licensed Work in a production environment typically requires a separate commercial license from the Licensor.
  – Automatic Conversion: On the Change Date, this BSL automatically converts to the Change License (MIT License, as specified in Parameters).

Core Terms of this BSL:
  1. Non-Production Use Only:
     You may use, copy, modify, and redistribute the Licensed Work solely for internal, non-production purposes, such as development, testing, prototyping, academic or personal study, and show-and-tell demonstrations.
     Any use beyond this scope—such as embedding into a product you sell, running it as part of a public Software-as-a-Service offering, or bundling it in an application you distribute—requires a separate commercial license from the Licensor, unless covered by an Additional Use Grant.

  2. Additional Use Grant:
     As specified in the Parameters section: None.

  3. Change Date:
     As specified in the Parameters section: The earlier of 2029-06-01 or the date published by the Licensor at https://btr.supply/licences.
     On this Change Date, the terms of this BSL will automatically be replaced by the terms of the Change License.

  4. Change License:
     As specified in the Parameters section: MIT License.
     Post-Change Date, you will no longer need a commercial license from the Licensor for uses previously restricted by this BSL; all downstream users will receive full rights under the MIT License.

  5. No Warranty Clause:
     The Licensed Work is provided "as is." The Licensor provides no warranties, express or implied, including (but not limited to) any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The Licensor will not be liable for any damages arising from the use of the Licensed Work.

Covenants of the Licensor (BTR Labs):
  • The Licensor will not change the text of the Business Source License 1.1 itself. Only the Parameters (Additional Use Grant, Change Date, Change License) may vary per release of the Licensed Work.
  • The Licensor commits that on the Change Date, all BSL restrictions will expire without requiring further action from users.
  • The Licensor promises that the Change License will always be the MIT License as specified in the Parameters (or a license with equivalent or greater permissive rights).

Why This Licensing Structure for BTR Supply?
  – Protect Early-Stage Value: Allows BTR Labs to build, iterate, and monetize production deployments of the Licensed Work without immediate concern for unsupported commercial use by others.
  – Attract Contributors: Full source availability encourages community feedback, bug fixes, integrations, and academic study of the Licensed Work.
  – Eventual Open Source: By the Change Date (2029 at the latest), the Licensed Work becomes a standard MIT-licensed project, ensuring long-term community access and use.

How This Plays Out:
  • A developer can fork the Licensed Work today, modify it, and run it on their local machine or a test server for non-production purposes.
  • If they wish to launch a public service using the Licensed Work or embed it in a product for sale before the Change Date, they must contact BTR Labs to arrange a commercial license.
  • On or after the Change Date (e.g., June 1, 2029, or an earlier date announced by BTR Labs), these commercial licensing requirements under the BSL cease, and the Licensed Work becomes freely available under the terms of the MIT License.
