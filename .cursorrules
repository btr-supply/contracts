# Project Structure

### Multi-Chain Architecture
- EVM code in `./evm` with `foundry.toml` configuration
- Solana code in `./solana` 
- Sui code in `./sui`

### Build Organization
- Project-wide scripts in `./scripts`
- EVM deployment scripts in `./evm/scripts` 
- Diamond pattern facets in `./evm/src/facets`

### Diamond Architecture (EVM)
- Uses Diamond pattern (EIP-2535) for modularity
- Three-step compilation via `./scripts/setup.sh`:
  1. Compile facets from `./evm/src/facets`
  2. Generate diamond deployment script
  3. Compile all components together

# Development Guidelines

### Core Principles
- Implement minimum viable solutions
- Choose narrow scope interpretations
- Require explicit approval for scope changes
- Use only `setup.sh` for builds

### Change Management
- Classify changes as:
  - [MINOR] (1-8 lines)
  - [MODERATE] (8-30 lines) 
  - [MAJOR] (30+ lines)
- Flag [COMPLEX] changes affecting 3+ files
- Provide implementation plans for [MAJOR] changes
- Document potential side effects

### Development Workflow
- Follow strict cycle: propose → approve → implement → review
- Pause after each [MAJOR] logical unit for approval, proceed autonomously otherwise
- Summarize changes and remaining work
- Do not request permission for cross-component changes unless major refactoring or deletion

### AI Agent Guidelines
- Maintain consistent code style
- Respect project conventions
- Provide clear reasoning for suggestions
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Break down complex tasks
- Validate assumptions
- Consider edge cases
- Focus on maintainability
- Document key decisions
- Highlight potential risks

### Communication Protocol
- Use clear status indicators ([COMPLETE], [PENDING], etc.)
- Provide progress summaries
- Request explicit confirmations
- Flag blockers immediately
- Document key assumptions
- Maintain audit trail
